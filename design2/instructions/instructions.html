				<p>It is an important skill for web designers to be able to analyze and critique websites. For this hands-on, we will be taking a look at a very popular yet very ugly website: IMDb. </p>
				<img src="assets/images/imdb.jpg" />
				<p>IMDb is the world's largest collection of movie, TV and celebrity info. Unfortunately, however, the IMDb website lacks good design and has a user interface that many people find difficult to navigate through. In order to address this issue, it is important to go through a three part design cycle:</p>
				<div class = "body-header">Step 1: Ideation</div>
				<p>Ideation is an important part of the design cycle which involves answering three fundamental questions about a particular website. Take some time to analyze IMDb, and see if you can answer the following questions:
					<ol>
						<li>What is the purpose of this website?</li>
						<li>What are the website's most important features? (Order them by priority with respect to the given website)</li>
						<li>What features can be improved upon?</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
				<div class = "body-header">Step 2: Prototype</div>
				<p>Prototyping your user interface involves creating sketches. In your group, discuss the aforementioned questions, and proceed to sketch out what you think the website <em>should</em> look like on the wireframe sheets we provided you with.</p>
				<div class = "body-header">Step 3: Evaluation & Presentation</div>
				<p>The final step of the design cycle is to get feedback from your peers. Please submit your sketches to a TA. The TA's will select two groups to present. We ask of the rest of the students to provide feedback by commenting on some of the design elements we discussed in class today including the positioning, spacing and typography used in each group's sketch.</p>
