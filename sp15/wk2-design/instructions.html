				<p>It is an important skill for web designers to learn how to ideate, prototype, and analyze websites. For this hands-on, we will be taking prototyping up the landing page of a dating website. </p>
				<!-- <img src="assets/images/imdb.jpg" />
				<p>IMDb is the world's largest collection of movie, TV and celebrity info. Unfortunately, however, the IMDb website lacks good design and has a user interface that many people find difficult to navigate through. In order to address this issue, it is important to go through a three part design cycle:</p> -->
				<div class = "body-header">Step 1: Ideation</div>

				<p>Ideation is an important part of the design cycle which involves answering a few fundamental questions about a particular website. Take some time to think about what goes into a dating website, and see if you can answer the following questions:
					<ol>
						<li>What is the purpose of this website?</li>
						<li>Who are the target users for this website?</li>
						<li>What are the website's most important features? (Order them by priority with respect to the given website)</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
				<div class = "body-header">Step 2: Prototype</div>
				<p>Prototyping your user interface involves creating sketches. In your group, discuss the aforementioned questions, and proceed to sketch out what you think the website <em>should</em> look like on the wireframe sheets we provided you with.</p>
				<div class = "body-header">Step 3: Evaluation &amp; Presentation</div>
				<p>The final step of the design cycle is to get feedback from your peers. Please submit your sketches to a TA. The TA's will select a few groups to present. We ask of the rest of the students to provide feedback by commenting on some of the design elements we discussed in class today including the positioning, spacing and typography used in each group's sketch.</p>
			<div class = "body-header">Case Study Example</div>
			<p> Finally, let's look at some example dating websites and see what the professionals have done. What do you think works better and what features can be improved upon given what you discussed and prototyped in your groups?</p></div>
